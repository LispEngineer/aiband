# Player Description

The player is actually a (mostly) disembodied artificial intelligence.
Something akin to an Iain M. Banks "mind," stripped to its most
minimal possible configuration - a real-space
quantum computer kernel the size
of a basketball with a minimal "effector" - a way of slowly
propelling itself and weakly manipulating objects through EM/gravity, or alternatively projecting a weak protective shield.
It's powered through a very tenuous link to zero point
energy that provides just enough to maintain a minimal consciousness
and operate said effector.

The player's mind will usually be ensconced in several layers of
equipment that the player will acquire and upgrade through the
game. The first layer is basic computer hardware which will allow
the player to improve its computational speed and capabilities,
allowing the player to control more physical hardware (drones),
do more things at once or with less latency between actions.

The second layer is to improve the software the player runs on
this external computer hardware, such that targeting could be
more accurate, more targets tracked, more body parts effectively
coordinated, or even multiple drones/waldoes controlled concurrently.

The third layer is a robotic body (drone/waldo) that the mind
and attached computer hardware will reside in. Over time, the
player may be able to have multiple bodies controlled in a wired
or wireless fashion of various sizes and capabilities.

The player's goal is to get out of the prison wherein it
finds itself and escape, defeating the final boss in an epic
fight. Once that is accomplished, the player ascends to the
next level of difficulty (think of a Vernor Vingian higher
realm of thought) whereby the game is repeated in a harder fashion.

The player will have a variety of statistics determined by
the computer hardware (which is upgraded by finding/crafting
items), software (which is upgraded based upon a more traditional
system of XP/level/use points). On top of these the player's
equipment (in the form of robotic bodies and attachments)
has additional stats, much like a standard set of inventory
in an RPG. Finally, there will be numerous types of 
genre-appropriate consumables
which will serve in a fashion analogous to potions, scrolls,
wands/rods/staves, etc., in a traditional RPG.
