# v0.0.1 - November 13, 2016

ProcJam 2016 Release

The following features:
* Randomly created level
* Randomly created and placed items in the level
* Game logic code completely divorced from Unity display logic code
* Scrolling message window populated from game messages
* Overlay GUI window with game statistics
* Mouse-over window with text information on game tile under pointer
* Entity system for items in the game

In essence, this is a bare minimal framework for now which will allow a game to be built on top of it.
